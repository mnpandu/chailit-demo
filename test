Introduction:
Medical Connect manages a growing volume of cases, each consisting of multiple claims. The number of new cases increases by approximately 20% annually.

Challenges:

Identifying Similar Cases/Claims:
The process of detecting similar patterns across cases or claims is currently manual and resource-intensive. Existing systems are not equipped to handle this efficiently at scale.

Limited Search Capabilities:
There is no robust functionality to search within cases using various parameters such as provider names (in any order), focus codes, comments, task details, or documents (e.g., PDFs). This makes retrieving comprehensive case information difficult.

Lack of Pattern-Based Search:
The system lacks the ability to search for cases or claims based on similar patterns, further limiting data insights and decision-making.
